## Coding Standards

### Swift (macOS)

- Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small

```swift
// Good
func startStreaming() throws {
    // Clear, focused implementation
}

// Avoid
func doStuff() {
    // Vague naming, unclear purpose
}
```

### Kotlin (Android)

- Follow Kotlin coding conventions
- Use Kotlin idioms (null safety, extension functions)
- Prefer immutability (`val` over `var`)
- Use meaningful names

```kotlin
// Good
private fun connectToHost(host: String, port: Int): Result<Connection>

// Avoid
private fun connect(h: String, p: Int): Any?
```

### General Guidelines

- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only when the "why" isn't obvious
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Test your changes before submitting
