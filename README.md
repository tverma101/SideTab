## About

Side Screen brings true second-display functionality to your Android tablet — over USB-C cable for the lowest latency, or wirelessly over WiFi after a one-time QR pair. Something macOS doesn't natively support either way.

While Apple's Sidecar only works with iPads, millions of Android tablets sit unused as potential workstations. Side Screen bridges that gap with hardware-accelerated H.265 streaming, sub-16ms pipeline latency on USB, and full touch input — making your tablet feel like a real monitor, not a laggy mirror.

Built entirely open-source, Side Screen is designed to be fast, lightweight, and seamlessly integrated.

## Features

### USB-C or Wireless

Two ways to connect, same picture quality. **USB-C** plugs in the cable for the lowest possible latency — the Mac app sets up adb-reverse forwarding for video on port `54321` and control on `54322`. **Wireless** lets you scan a QR code from the Mac; the tablet remembers the pairing and you can tap **Reconnect** on later launches (5 GHz strongly recommended). The auth token is generated locally and stays on your Mac; reset it any time to revoke access.

### Virtual Display

Create a true virtual display on your Mac. Drag windows to your tablet like a real monitor — not mirroring, but extending.

### Ultra-Low Latency

Hardware-accelerated H.265 encoding on Mac and decoding on Android. Async pipeline architecture delivers frames in under 30ms.

</div>

### Touch Support

Use your tablet's touchscreen to interact with macOS. Touch prediction compensates for network latency, making taps and drags feel natural.

Samsung S Pen contact is handled as a direct drawing stroke rather than a touch scroll gesture. Current Mac/Android builds also forward pen pressure, hover movement, tilt/orientation metadata, and the S Pen secondary button. Pressure is delivered through macOS's tablet-style mouse event fields, so apps that read mouse/tablet pressure can vary brush width; this is not a kernel-level Wacom/Apple tablet driver.

### HiDPI (Retina) Support

Enable HiDPI mode to render at 2× resolution internally — text and icons are sharp at any logical resolution, just like a MacBook Retina display. Perfect for users with 2K/4K tablets who want a readable workspace without sacrificing sharpness.

### Gaming Mode

Enable Gaming Boost for the bounded ultra-low-latency encoder profile. The host pins this mode to its low-bitrate real-time profile; actual throughput depends on the selected display and device.

### Customizable

Configure resolution (up to 4K/8K), frame rate (30–120 FPS; 60 FPS is the current balanced default), bitrate and quality presets from the Mac app. The host applies a bounded encoder ladder rather than treating the UI bitrate as an unrestricted wire rate.

### Power-aware Android playback

While Side Screen is actively streaming in the foreground, the Android client requests the panel's 120 Hz mode when the tablet is externally powered—even if Android Battery Saver is enabled. On battery it requests 60 Hz to reduce display, decoder, and thermal load. When the app is backgrounded, the screen is off, or the session is disconnected, it clears its frame-rate and screen-on requests; an unused session is disconnected after the configured grace period (capped at 30 seconds on battery), allowing Android's normal screen timeout, Doze, and Battery Saver policies to take over. The Mac host still needs to be configured for a 120 FPS stream for the transport to carry 120 frames per second.

### Headless / portable Mac (new in 0.11.0)

Run a Mac with no display of its own — a Mac Studio or Mini on the go, or a laptop in clamshell — using the tablet as its only screen. Enable Launch at Login and Auto-start streaming, and the Mac boots straight into serving the tablet, with nothing to press on the Mac.

## Requirements

| | macOS Host | Android Client |
|---|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS 13 (Ventura)+ | Android 8.0 (API 26)+ |
| **Hardware** | Apple Silicon or Intel | H.265 hardware decoder |
| **USB mode** | USB-C port + `adb` (`brew install android-platform-tools`) | USB-C cable + USB Debugging enabled |
| **Wireless mode** | Same WiFi network as the tablet (5 GHz recommended) | Camera (for QR scan) + Google Play Services (for ML Kit barcode) |

---

## Installation

Download the latest release from [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/tranvuongquocdat/SideScreen/releases):

- **macOS**: Download `.dmg`, open it, drag Side Screen to Applications
- **Android**: Download `.apk`, install on your tablet (enable "Unknown sources" if needed). Port forwarding is handled automatically by the Mac app.

> **⚠️ macOS Gatekeeper**
> If macOS says the app is "damaged", open Terminal and run:
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app
> ```
> Then open the app again. This is needed because the app is not notarized with an Apple Developer certificate.

> **⚠️ ADB Required**
> The Mac app needs `adb` to communicate with your Android device. If the app doesn't show "Running" after launch, you likely need to install ADB:
>
> 1. Install Homebrew (if you don't have it):
>    ```bash
>    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
>    ```
> 2. Install ADB:
>    ```bash
>    brew install --cask android-platform-tools
>    ```

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source (for developers)</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tranvuongquocdat/SideScreen.git
cd SideScreen

# macOS
cd MacHost && swift build -c release

# Android
(cd AndroidClient && ./gradlew assembleDebug)

# Preserve every local APK and the currently installed APK before installing
./scripts/backup_android_apks.sh
```

The backup helper creates a non-overwriting snapshot under
`backups/apk/<UTC-timestamp>/`. Each snapshot includes the available debug and
release APK outputs, `installed-base.apk` when a connected ADB device has Side
Screen installed, and `MANIFEST.txt` with version, signing-certificate, source
revision, device, and SHA-256 details. Set `SIDESCREEN_ADB_SERIAL` when more
than one Android device is connected.
</details>

## Usage

### USB mode (default — lowest latency)

1. Connect tablet to Mac via **USB-C**
2. Launch **Side Screen** on Mac (runs in menu bar — port forwarding is set up automatically)
3. Open **Side Screen** on tablet → keep on the **USB** tab → tap **Connect**
4. Done — drag windows to your new display

### Wireless mode (new in 0.8.0 — no cable)

1. Launch **Side Screen** on Mac → toggle to the **Wireless** tab → a QR code appears
2. Open **Side Screen** on tablet → switch to the **Wireless** tab → tap **Scan QR Code** → grant camera permission → aim at the QR on the Mac
3. The tablet remembers the Mac. On subsequent launches, open the Wireless tab and tap **Reconnect** — no rescan is needed unless the token or Mac address changed.

Wireless mode requires both devices to be on the same WiFi network. **5 GHz is strongly recommended** — 2.4 GHz can introduce noticeable jitter on dynamic content. The pairing token authenticates the wireless stream but does not currently provide end-to-end encryption, so use a trusted network. If you need to revoke access, click **Reset Token (forget all)** on the Mac and re-pair each tablet.

USB mode remains the lowest-latency option for drawing or fast-paced gaming. Wireless adds 10–50 ms depending on WiFi quality.

### Headless mode (new in 0.11.0 — no Mac interaction)

In Settings → Startup, turn on **Launch at Login** and **Auto-start streaming on launch**, then pick the **Startup mode** (USB or Wireless). On your next login the server starts automatically — just open Side Screen on the tablet and tap Connect (USB) or Reconnect (Wireless).

First-time setup still needs a screen once to grant Screen Recording permission; after that the Mac runs fully headless. For wireless headless use, give the Mac a static IP or DHCP reservation, and consider enabling macOS Screen Sharing as a fallback way in.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>"SideScreen is damaged" on macOS</strong></summary>

This happens because the app is not notarized by Apple. Run this command to fix it:
```bash
sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SideScreen.app
```
Then open the app again.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Connection refused" on Android</strong></summary>

The Mac app sets up `adb reverse` automatically when streaming starts. If it still fails, make sure `adb` is installed (via Android SDK or Homebrew: `brew install android-platform-tools`) and your device has USB debugging enabled.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Android keeps trying to reconnect</strong></summary>

Current Android builds only connect after you tap **Connect** or **Reconnect**. They do not resume a saved session or retry a dropped connection by themselves. Reinstall the current APK if an older build is still running, then launch the app again.

The connection checklist checks tablet-local prerequisites while idle; it does not open a Mac socket until you explicitly connect.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>High latency or stuttering</strong></summary>

- Lower resolution or frame rate
- Ensure H.265 hardware codec support on your device
- For USB mode, use a high-quality USB-C cable (not charge-only)
- For wireless mode, ensure both devices are on **5 GHz WiFi**, not 2.4 GHz; reduce refresh rate to 60 Hz if jitter persists
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Wireless: "Couldn't reach Mac" / connection times out</strong></summary>

- Both devices must be on the same WiFi network (and same subnet — some mesh routers isolate "guest" devices)
- Click **Start** on the Mac before scanning the QR — the listener only binds when the server is running
- If the Mac changes WiFi or its LAN IP, scan a fresh QR (the cached one points to the old address)
- macOS may prompt for **Local Network** permission on first wireless toggle — grant it; without it, LAN inbound is silently dropped
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Wireless: "Re-pair required" after restart / reinstall</strong></summary>

The Mac's auth token resets when you click **Reset Token (forget all)** or reinstall the app. Tap **Scan QR Code** on the Android client and scan the new QR shown on the Mac.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Virtual display not appearing</strong></summary>

Grant Screen Recording permission: **System Preferences → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → Enable Side Screen**
</details>
