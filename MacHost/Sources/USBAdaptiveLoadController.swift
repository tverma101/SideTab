/// Motion-side adaptive FPS controller for high-refresh USB sessions.
///
/// Primary pressure signals:
///   - multiple Network.framework sends still outstanding before `contentProcessed`
///   - `contentProcessed` taking multiple target-frame intervals
///   - repeated decoder recovery/keyframe pulses in a short window
///   - capture-to-encoder-output age staying over several target-frame periods
/// Corroborating signal:
///   - TCP send-buffer headroom becoming critically small
///
/// Network.framework can accept a message larger than the currently available
/// kernel send buffer, so frameBytes > availableSendBuffer is NOT by itself
/// evidence of congestion. Apple recommends `contentProcessed` as the live-data
/// pacing point; this controller therefore gives completion timing/backlog more
/// weight than instantaneous send-buffer capacity.
///
/// Host encode-age strikes are tracked separately from transport mild-pressure
/// strikes. A fast network completion must not erase evidence that VideoToolbox
/// itself is falling behind. Conversely, one slow encode followed by a healthy
/// encode resets the encode-age streak so distant outliers do not accumulate.
///
/// A single recovery pulse is expected during startup, reconnect, or a decoder
/// reset. MediaCodec starvation, however, produces repeated forced-IDR requests
/// (the Android client throttles forced requests to 200 ms). Three pulses inside
/// one second are therefore treated as strong downstream decoder pressure.
///
/// Explicit recovery also creates an unusually large IDR. A short grace window
/// ignores transport/encode pressure caused by that IDR itself, preventing a
/// normal startup/recovery burst from teaching the controller that 120 FPS is
/// unstable. Recovery-burst pressure is never suppressed by this grace window.
///
/// The policy is intentionally asymmetric: congestion falls back quickly,
/// while recovery is slower and requires healthy completions. That hysteresis
/// prevents a marginal 120-Hz path from bouncing 120 <-> 90 every few frames.
///
/// The transport generation is supplied by WirelessTransportPressure (despite
/// that historical type name it owns both USB and Wi-Fi send accounting). Old
/// callbacks from a replaced connection therefore cannot perturb a new USB
/// session.
